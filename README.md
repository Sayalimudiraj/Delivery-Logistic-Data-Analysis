# Delivery-Logistic-Data-Analysis
Delivery & Logistics Data Analysis Dashboard

📝 Short Description / Purpose

An interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze logistics and delivery performance. The purpose of this project is to uncover patterns in shipment volumes, delivery times, delays, and efficiency across various routes to support operational decision-making.

🛠 Tech Stack

Power BI → Data Visualization & Dashboarding
Excel/CSV → Data preprocessing & transformation

📂 Data Source

Logistics & Delivery dataset sourced from Kaggle / public dataset.

✨ Features & Highlights

📦 Total Shipments & Distance – Track delivery volume (8,908 shipments) and total distance covered (1M).
⏱️ Delivery Efficiency Metrics – KPIs such as average delivery time (71), on-time deliveries (73%), and delayed shipments (27%).
📊 Cutoff Analysis – Classification of shipments completed before and after cutoff times.
📅 Day & Week Analysis – Cutoff completion patterns across weekdays and weekend performance.
🚛 Route Type Insights – Distribution of shipments by route types (Carting, FTL).
🔎 Operational Trends – OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine) vs. actual delivery time & distance to identify inefficiencies.
📈 Scan-to-Scan Distances – Visualization of shipment tracking from start to end.
📍 Actionable KPIs – Identify improvement areas in logistics operations to reduce delays.

📍 Key Insights from the Dashboard

🚚 Total Shipments: 8,908 shipments covering 1M distance units.
⏱️ Average Delivery Time: 71 (units/days depending on dataset).
✅ On-time Deliveries: 73% of shipments; 27% are delayed.
🔎 Cutoff Analysis:
12.3K (27.22%) shipments missed the cutoff.
32.9K (72.78%) shipments met the cutoff.

📅 Cutoff by Day:

Best performing day: Friday (70.49% cutoff completion).
Lowest performance: Monday (69.37%).

🛣️ OSRM vs. Actual: Variations observed in estimated vs. actual time & distance indicate potential route inefficiencies.

🕒 Day-wise Performance: Certain weekdays show higher actual delivery times, requiring process improvements.

🚛 Route Types: Majority of deliveries are carting-based, with lower distribution in FTL routes.
